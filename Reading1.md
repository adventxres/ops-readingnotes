Case Study 
How is a hardware hack different than a software hack?
Hardware hacks use actual hardware pieces and alter the security and use it in ways it was not intended, such as gaining access to information, make it malfunction, or have total control over it. A software hack is exploiting security weaknesses in the target system by doing things like installing malware, stealing data, or destroying it.  
What are the two ways for spies to alter a computerâ€™s hardware? Interdiction, manipulation of devices as they are in transit from the manufacturer to the customer. Other involves seeding changes from the beginning 
Explain how the hack worked. The chips had been inserted during the manufacturing process. They had spies place a tiny chip smaller than a grain of rice but it was placed on the board. It being so small it could only do two functions, tell the device to communicate with other devices that were loaded with more complex codes elsewhere and prepare the operating system to accept new codes. The company Supermicro working with several different companies and third parties helped lose track of security and allowed for china to place spies to infiltrate the US. 
How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source? Hardware hacks are able to be traced unlike software hacks, they leave a trail. They were able to track back the malicious chips to four subcontracting factories.
